#Evaluation Report

## Through out this challenge, I have found that using logistic regression was a better pick than the linear support vector classification model. 
## For the reason that, in the SVC Report (Ref. PNG image titled SVC Report) I was only able to predict the stop signal 43% of the time and
## only able to reach a 4% recall, which is less than ideal. Although in the case of the Logisitic regression model (Ref. PNG image titled
## LR Report), I was able to report the stop signals 44% of the time and obtained a recall of 33%. Even with that information aside, the average 
## accuracy of the models as a whole were more accurate using the Logistic Regression Model than the Linear Support Vector Classification Model.
